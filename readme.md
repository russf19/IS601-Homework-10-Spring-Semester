## Reflection
This was a challenging assignment as we needed to review the code and check to see if there were any issues such as data inconsistencies. What I learned from the assignment is that it is very important to go through the code several times as you may miss little things like the bio information for John Doe not matching in one are. I've also learned that there are better ways to write code such as in issue 8. model_construct is deleted from the function to ensure that the validation process is not skipped.

I also learned that issue tracking is a powerful Github feauture that allows you to track issues, and create a seperate branch so you can just focus on that issue and not worry about affecting the rest of the code. It's usually very useful that you can easily merge the changes to your main branch with a pull reuest. I can see how this will be extremely helpful in a team environment as you are able to review the issues other people are working on and compare it to the base code. You can also use it in a collaborative environment so you don't affect the main branch of code, just the new branch you created.
